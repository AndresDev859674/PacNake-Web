            <h2>NEW PACSNAKE WINDOWS!!!, Wednesday, March 5, 2025</h2>
            <p>THE OLD PACSNAKE IS BACK!!! The creator, me, discovered that I was more interested in the old one and not the new one, I didn't understand the new one's code well, but I understand everything about the old one, and I also discovered the power of pygame_menu making the menu and stuff better, python is the best, Now we have 2 editions, 1 the web edition, 2 windows editions.</p>

            <h2>NEW PACNAKE!!!!, 14/12/2024</h2>
            <p>PACNAKE HAS CHANGED TO PACSNAKE!!! As incredible as it may seem, PacNake has changed to PacSnake. It is more modern and more comfortable, although it does not have all the functions of the original PacSnake (the old one). Thanks to everyone!</p>
